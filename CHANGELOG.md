### Saving all previously set values in module config
If you have changed some of the configuration settings inside the module configuration and you have pressed the button
to scan for new files afterwards, all previously set changes were lost.
In this version, this behavior was eliminated. So if you press the button to update your font files, all previously
done changes inside your module configuration were saved before, so they will not get lost anymore.
Some minor code optimizations were done too to optimize the performance.
